                <h3>Stellarsphere</h3>
                <p>An interactive space exploration website with 3D animations. Developed an interactive website showcasing the past, present, and future of space exploration, featuring 3D visualizations with three.js, animations, and media integration. Key sections include a mystery section exploring cosmic phenomena, an interactive solar system with detailed planet information and parallax effects, and a space-themed Phaser game, all designed to create an engaging and educational user experience.</p>

                <h3>Spotify Clone</h3>
                <p>A music streaming platform with custom playlists and seamless navigation. This project is a Spotify Clone built with React and the Spotify Web API, allowing users to log in with their Spotify accounts, browse playlists, search for tracks and artists, and play music in real-time. The application features a responsive design for smooth usage across devices, enhancing accessibility. Utilized React.js for the user interface, CSS for styling, and Axios for API calls. Node.js and Express.js for handling requests efficiently. The Spotify Web API for fetching user data and music content. This project provided me with valuable experience in working with APIs, managing state in React, and creating a user-friendly, responsive design.</p>

                <h3>E-commerce Platform</h3>
                <p>An online store with a secure checkout system and product browsing. Developed a grade calculator in C that processes student scores to determine final grades based on predefined criteria. Implemented features to compute average scores, apply grading thresholds, and output final grades. Utilized core C programming concepts such as arrays, loops, and conditionals to ensure accurate and efficient calculations.</p>
